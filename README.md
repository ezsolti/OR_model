# Budapest Training Reactor Serpent2 model

- Geometry based on publicly available info. See links in the input deck. Main inspiration and further reading on the reactor at [reak.bme.hu](http://www.reak.bme.hu/en/training-reactor/training-reactor.html)
- Some approximations were needed. See comments

# Possible ideas for use in education

- Try to build a simplified model with students (ie. only normal assemblies)
- Reactivity reserve, control rod worth and curves. Coefficients.
- Study the impact of S(a,b) tables
- Tally spectrum, heat deposition (use edepmode 3)
- Place neutron source and perform subcritical studies (observe neutron detector/leakage signal vs k-eff). Remove reflectors. Remove fuel. Step with control rod.
- Calculate dose rates. Use WW.

The deck is not totally elegant, nevertheless if you manage to spot a mistake, or have better data on certain things, let me know.
